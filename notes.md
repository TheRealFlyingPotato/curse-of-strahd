## Torokka Reading
* 4 of Stars (Abjurer)
  * This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.
  * I see a fallen house guarded by a great stone dragon. Look to the highest peak.
* 7 of Swords (Hooded One)
  * This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.
  * I see a faceless god. He awaits you at the end of a long and winding road, deep in the mountains.
* Master of Swords (Warrior)
  * This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.
  * That which you seek lies in the womb of darkness, the devil's lair: the one place he must return.
